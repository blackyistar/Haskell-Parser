# Haskell-Parser
Gridlock is a simple colouring game played between two players. I developed a Haskell program that parses written records of Gridlock games and allows users to replay them directly in the Linux terminal.

My program is run using the following command,
stack run -- <filepath>

Here is an example of a file path for a gridlock game: examples\parsing\pass\3x3.gridlock
