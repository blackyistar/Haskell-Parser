# Haskell-Parser
Gridlock is a simple colouring game played between two players. As a coursework assignment, I had to develop a Haskell program that parses written records of Gridlock games and allows users to replay them directly in the Linux terminal.

Here is an example of a filepath for a gridlock game: examples\parsing\pass\3x3.gridlock

My program is run using the following command,

stack run -- filepath
